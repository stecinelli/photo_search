# Photo Searchs

In this app I created a frontend with React, Typescript and Boostrap.

<img src="/Screenshot Web - Photo Search.jpg" alt="Screenshot Web" title="Screenshot Web" width="40%" height="40%"/> &nbsp; <img src="/Screenshot Web 2 - Photo Search.jpg" alt="Screenshot Web" title="Screenshot Web" width="30%" height="30%"/>

## Frontend

- Displays a search input, were you need to type a key word for searching a photo.
- It will display all the photos that correspond to your search. 
- Have pagination for you to see all the available photos.

## Setup
- In this repo, go to 'client' folder and do a 'npm i' && 'npm start'.
