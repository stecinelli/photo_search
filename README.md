# Photo Searchs

In this app I created a frontend with React, Typescript and Boostrap.

<img src="/Screenshot Web - Photo Search.jpg" alt="Screenshot Web" title="Screenshot Web" width="25%" height="25%"/> &nbsp; <img src="/Screenshot Web 2 - Photo Search.jpg" alt="Screenshot Web" title="Screenshot Web" width="30%" height="30%"/>

## Frontend

- It display a search form, were you need to input key word for photos.
- It display all the photos that correspond to your search. 
- It has pagination for you to see all the available photos.

## Setup
- In this repo, go to client folder and do a npm i && npm start.
